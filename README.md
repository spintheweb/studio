# Spin the Web Studio&trade;

Spin the Web Studio&trade; is a Spin the Web project for managing Spin the Web projects. In this context, a project may be web sites, portals, intranet, extranets, web apps or web services here collectively referred to as _webos_.

The difference between a regular site and a webo is the presence of a *WBDL* file (Webbase Description Language) and, naturally, the webo is hosted in a server running a Web Spinner. The WBDL file describes the webo: its contents, routing, authorization and internationalization.

Spin the Web Studio&trade; is a GUI for managing webos.
